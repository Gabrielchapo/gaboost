# Machine Learning from scratch

The objective is to implement a Neural Network for classification problem.

In Python => Folder Python

In C      => foldef C (work in progress)

## Getting Started

You need to download the MNIST DATASET (Train and test separated) in json encoded and put it in /data file

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
